Genesis-V3
==========
These are the 3D design files for FarmBot Genesis V3 - natively produced in SolidWorks 2014. You will probably need to download the Open Builds Parts repo for the SolidWorks assemblies to fully load properly.

Improvements from V2 include: Updated bracket design for great simplification and ease of assembly, cable routing holes and extra hardware for a trolley style system to carry the cables across long distances, universal tool mount simplification and manufacturability improvements, fixed issue with gantry belts running into screws, added simple endstop integration onto plates, moved z-axis leadscrew block to be closer to gantry for greater strength and less induced moment force.
